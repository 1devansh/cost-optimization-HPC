# Cost-optimized Parallel Computations using Volatile Cloud Resources

- Algorithm.py file contains general implementation of algorithm to find optimum cost and time taken in parallel

- BetaVariableGraph.py contains trend of Cost as a function of processors vs Number of processors visualized in a 2-D Graph with beta taken as a variable value.

- CwVariableGraph.py contains trend of Cost as a function of processors vs Number of processors visualized in a 2-D Graph with Cw - opportunity cost as a variable value.

- alphaVariable3D.py contains trend of Cost as a function of processors, Number of processors visualized and alpha - probability of availabilty of volatile processor in a 3-D Graph

- diffCw3D.py contains trend of Cost as a function of processors, Number of processors visualized and alpha - probability of availabilty of volatile processor in a 3-D Graph but also a different value of opportunity cost(Cw).
